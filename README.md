# Ingredients for a DevOps cake

## [Live slides](https://weyensluk.github.io/Ingredients-for-a-DevOps-cake)

## Abstract
In this talk I will be sharing my experience as a DevOps member. In most teams, DevOps is usually the trash can where anything goes. It is littered with several small projects, written in several different languages, with lackluster support from the other team members.

Enter, [Cake](cakebuild.net). By using the same language in your DevOps environment as your main development language, you ensure that knowledge and readibility will not be an issue for anyone. And it further cements the DevOps role as a shared responsibility by all team members.

Most of the talk will be demoing and showcaseing the abilities of Cake. We'll start off by creating a pretty basic Cake script that builds a solution. We'll further expand it by adding support for Unit Tests and Code Coverage.
Next up, integrating this whole deal in a CI environment. Complete with linking metadata, to exception handling.
Now what if I want to do something for which there is no support from Cake? That's cool, we'll take a look at integrating your external code in Cake in 3 different methods.

At the end of the talk we'll take a global look at how to go further from here on out and how this approach creates a healthy ecosystem for your DevOps scripts to live in.
